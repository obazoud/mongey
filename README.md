Todo
----

 * Well, since I just started this todo is only a few ideas i haven't touched yet.
 * Add User document. Don't really know if it's gonna be a multi-user app yet but atleast it's a good place to store settings and stuff.
 * Add Currency support. This feels like a big one, it's probably good to get it in early.
