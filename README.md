So far this is mostly an experiment with mongodb and a app i have wanted to 
build for some time. Mongo lets you do some cool things, and try them realy

Currently you should be able to:

 * Create a new user, and login
 * Create a bankaccount
 * Create a payment, which should create two transactions (credit/debit)
 * Create a deposits, which also should create two transactions

Todo
